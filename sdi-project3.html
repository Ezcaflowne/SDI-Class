<article>
<p>This week I chose to do a daily routine at my work, interact with co workers and go through the day with ordinary tasks.</p>
<p>So my sotry is pretty basic routine. I get up, go to work. Interact with coworkers. In my particular job field us maintenance people have to get apartments ready, or turn the apartment as we call it. Get it ready for the next people that would like to rent it, its a huge same old routine everyday and it gets kinda borning sometimes. So i threw in some little things that kept it interesting. Like a dead battery for example or a maintenance person had a class to go to etc..</p>
