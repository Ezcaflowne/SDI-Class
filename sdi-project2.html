<p>This story is about how sometimes at work one of us carries the 24-hour emergency maintenance cell phone. So at anytime no matter how late or early we could be called to perform some kind of maintenance. This however is not for some type of maintenance like a light bulb is out, or one of the burners on your stove might not be working. We as maintenance live by a code, that is, "Flood, Blood, or Fire." Staying with in those terms its an emergency.</p>
<p>In this story a resident saying that something is wrong with their water heater wakes me up early in the morning. If this water heater is leaking then I must replaced it, and if any sort of water goes onto the carpet, the carpet must have a water extraction. Having no water extraction will eventually have adverse effects. Such things like mold might start to grow. Or a bad mildew smell could also accrue. This then will make the resident complain about health problems and we donâ€™t need that.</p>
